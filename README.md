**AIMER: Calibration-Free Task-Agnostic MoE Pruning**

AIMER, short for **Absolute mean over root mean square IMportance for Expert Ranking**, is a simple, weight-only criterion for post-training pruning of mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models. Instead of collecting router statistics or activation traces on a calibration set, AIMER ranks experts directly from pretrained weights, prunes them uniformly layer by layer, saves a standard Hugging Face checkpoint, and supports downstream evaluation with the same benchmark stack used in the paper.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository gives you a minimal end-to-end pipeline:

```text

  AIMER expert scoring
        |
        v
uniform layer-wise pruning
        |
        v
  pruned HF checkpoint
        |
        v
evaluation with lm-eval / EvalPlus / LiveCodeBench / EvalScope / WildBench
```

## ✨ Highlights

- Calibration-free pruning. No calibration corpus, router statistics, or activation collection is required for AIMER scoring.
- Weight-only ranking. Expert scores are computed directly from pretrained expert parameters.
- Uniform expert pruning. The released CLI prunes the same number of experts from each detected MoE layer.
- Standard checkpoint export. Pruned models are saved with `save_pretrained(...)` and can be evaluated directly.
- Paper-aligned evaluation wrappers. The repo includes scripts for multiple-choice QA, coding, math, and WildBench-style evaluation.

## 🛠️ Installation


```bash
bash scripts/build.sh
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### ✂️ Prune a model with AIMER

Use the pruning CLI directly when you only want the pruned checkpoint and score tables:

```bash
python src/reap/calib_free_prune.py \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 \
  --metric aimer \
  --sparsity-ratio 0.25 \
  --output-dir artifacts/calib-free/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/aimer_0.250_uniform \
  --device-map auto \
  --torch-dtype bfloat16 \
  --metric-device auto \
  --local-files-only false \
  --trust-remote-code true
```

Behavior worth knowing:

- Higher AIMER scores are treated as more removable, so those experts are pruned.
- Pruning is always uniform across detected MoE layers.
- `--local-files-only` defaults to `true`, so set it to `false` if the model is not already cached locally.
- `--metric-device cpu` is useful if you want scoring to run from CPU copies after model load.

### ▶️ Prune and evaluate in one command

For the paper-style workflow, use the wrapper:

```bash
bash experiments/calib-free-cli.sh \
  0,1 \
  Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 \
  aimer \
  0.25 \
  42
```

This wrapper:

1. sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
2. prunes the checkpoint with AIMER
3. writes the pruned model under `artifacts/calib-free/...`
4. runs the evaluation pipeline

The first positional argument is the CUDA device mask. The wrapper also derives the serving port from the first visible GPU as `8300 + first_device`.

Minimal example:

```bash
bash scripts/command_calibfree.sh
```

Important default:

- [`experiments/calib-free-cli.sh`](experiments/calib-free-cli.sh) enables all benchmark groups by default, including WildBench.



## 📊 Evaluation

You can evaluate either an original checkpoint or a pruned checkpoint directly:

```bash
python src/reap/eval.py \
  --model-name artifacts/calib-free/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/aimer_0.250_uniform \
  --seed 42 \
  --use-server true \
  --vllm_port 8300 \
  --run-lm-eval true \
  --run-evalplus true \
  --run-livecodebench true \
  --run-math true \
  --run-wildbench false \
  --results_dir artifacts/calib-free/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/aimer_0.250_uniform/eval_vllm
```


## 📦 Output Layout

Pruned checkpoints are saved under:

```text
artifacts/calib-free/<model-name>/<metric>_<ratio>_uniform/
```

Typical contents:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `config.json`, model weights, tokenizer files | standard saved Hugging Face checkpoint |
| `pruned_experts.json` | pruned expert ids per layer |
| `pruning_plan.json` | per-layer kept/pruned counts |
| `calib_free_metadata.json` | pruning metadata |
| `calib_free_scores.csv` | raw per-expert AIMER scores |
| `calib_free_score_table.csv` | scores, within-layer rank, and prune decision |
| `eval_vllm/` or `eval_hf/` | evaluation outputs |
| `*.log` | wrapper logs when using the shell scripts |
